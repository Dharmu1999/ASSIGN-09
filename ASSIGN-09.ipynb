    "The user of a car doesn't need to know about the complex mechanics of the engine, transmission, or other components. They only need to know how to drive the car using the steering wheel, pedals, and gearshift. The user interacts with the car based on its essential features without knowing its underlying implementation details. Thus, abstraction helps in presenting a simplified view of the car to the user.\n",

    "Encapsulation:\n",

    "The car is encapsulated into a single unit that contains its data and methods. The engine, transmission, and other components are hidden from the outside world and can only be accessed through defined interfaces, such as the gas pedal, brake pedal, or gearshift. The user cannot directly access or modify the internal workings of the car without going through the defined interfaces. Thus, encapsulation helps in protecting the car's internal state from outside interference.\n",
